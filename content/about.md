Hi! I'm Shumayl (üëü + üõ£Ô∏è, shoe-mile). I build secure systems and occasionally yap about it.

I'm a Software Engineer on the Security Engineering team at Grab, where I work on automated vulnerability management. Before that, I developed cloud security guardrails (automated remediations) at Deloitte Global and worked on process digitalization at HP Inc.

I studied Applied Physics (Nanotechnology) at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, but these days you'll find me deep in AWS documentation instead of physics textbooks.

Physics degree ‚ûî Materials research ‚ûî Tech. Weird path, I know. I even co-wrote [a paper on hybrid bioplastics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34208796/) during my time at the Materials Research Institute ([now called PRISM](https://prism.tus.ie/apt-gateway/)) in Ireland.

Want to chat about cloud security, automation, or that one time I tried to make microwave-attenuating materials from shrimp shells? Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl) or drop me a line at [shumaylasmawi@gmail.com](mailto:shumaylasmawi@gmail.com).
