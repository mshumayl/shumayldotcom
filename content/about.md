My name is Shumayl Asmawi, and I am a Systems Engineer at HP Inc (Hewlett-Packard). In my professional life, I build software systems that support HP's manufacturing operations, from web apps to industrial data pipelines. 

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with open source projects and building with cool new software technologies. I also created [AI-Daleel](https://ai-daleel.com/), an AI-powered al-Quran research tool.

On this site, I share my insights, knowledge, and ideas on the things that I learn and discover in my professional and personal projects. Most of my personal projects are open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/mshumayl/).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shumayl_), where I am happy to connect with like-minded individuals, professionals, and fellow nerds.
