Hi! I'm Shumayl. I'm a cloud engineer at Deloitte, working with the global AWS platform team. Previously, I was a systems engineer with the Digital Transformation team at HP Inc.

My current interests revolve around infrastructure-as-code, microservices, and cloud automation. I also enjoy exploring and writing about technology and software in general.

I am a proud alumnus of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, where I obtained a degree in physics.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with open source projects and building with cool new software technologies. I created [AI-Daleel](https://ai-daleel.com/) to help me easily search for Quranic verses.

On this site, I share my insights, knowledge, and ideas on the things that I learn and discover in my professional and personal projects. Most of my personal projects are open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/mshumayl/).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shumayl_), where I am happy to connect with like-minded individuals, professionals, and fellow nerds.
