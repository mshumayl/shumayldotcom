Hi, my name is Shumayl Asmawi, and I am a Systems Engineer at HP Inc. In my professional life, I specialize in developing analytics web apps and dashboards, creating in-house ETL pipelines, and building productivity tools for engineers. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with open source projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/mshumayl/). I also created [AI-Daleel](https://ai-daleel.com/), an AI-powered al-Quran research tool.

On this site, I share my insights, knowledge, and ideas on the things that I learn and discover in my work and personal projects. Most of my personal projects are open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/mshumayl/).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@shumayl), where I am happy to connect with like-minded individuals, professionals, and fellow nerds.
