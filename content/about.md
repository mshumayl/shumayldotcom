My name is Shumayl.

I am currently a cloud engineer at Deloitte Global, working on platform engineering. Previously, I was a systems engineer with the digital transformation team at HP Inc.

I post my writings on this site as a way to reinforce my learnings and share what I have learnt with the community.

I am a proud alumnus of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, where I obtained a Bsc. in Applied Physics.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shumayl_), where I am happy to connect with like-minded individuals, professionals, and fellow nerds.
